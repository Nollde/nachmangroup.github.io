The goal of these lectures is to introduce you to the basic principles and jargon of collider-based high energy physics (HEP) so that you can quickly integrate into the ATLAS research team.  It is essential that you also build some familiarity with ROOT.  Below are links to typed versions of some of the lecture notes.
